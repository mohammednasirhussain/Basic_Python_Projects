    "#An Email slicer is a very useful program for separating the username and domain name of an email address.\n",
    "#To create an email slicer with Python, our task is to write a program that \n",
    "#can retrieve the username and the domain name of the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "#For example, look at the image below which shows the domain and username of “nasirhussain116@gmail.com”:\n",
    "#So we need to divide the email into two strings using ‘@’ as the separator.\n",
    "#Let’s see how to separate the email and domain name with Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "email = input(\"Enter Your Email: \").strip()\n",
    "username = email[:email.index(\"@\")]\n",
    "domain_name = email[email.index(\"@\")+1:]\n",

    "print(format_)\n",
    "\n",
    "#The code above is very simple and easy to understand. We take user input and use the strip function at the same time \n",
    "#to remove white space if any. Then we are finding the index of ‘@’ symbol of the user input. \n",
    "#Then we store the index into a variable known as domain_name to split the email into two parts; the user name and the domain.\n"

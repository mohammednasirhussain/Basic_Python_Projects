    "#Age Calculator is an amazing application to create as a beginner in any programming language. \n",
    "#To create an age calculator, you need two dates:\n",

    "# 2. date of birth\n",
    "#You can either ask the user for both dates or just ask for the date of birth and use today’s date from the computer itself.\n",

    "#Then I am subtracting the dob with today’s date and then dividing it by 365.25 which is returning the age of the user."
